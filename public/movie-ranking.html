<h1>MY TOP 3</h1>
<h2>The TOP 3 movies of all time!</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Hurricane</h3>
<p>The true story of Rubin "Hurricane" Carter which also became a song by Bob Dylan.</p>
<h3>Million dollar baby</h3>
<p>Another "boxing" movie directed by my favorite Clint Eastwood</p>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Matthew McConaughey's best acting after "Dallas Buyers Club". The movie that explains best string theory and time stretching.</p>
